# MeliChallengeApp

### This app is the solution to the challenge for iOS developer.
Fulfilling the three requirements initially raised:

1. Search field.
2. Display of search results.
3. Detail of a product.

The design pattern used during the construction of the application is MVP (Model View Presenter), which gives us an excellent advantage in terms of low code coupling, assignment of modular responsibilities, code reusability, flexibility in development and greater ease. in building tests to our code.

Thanks to this pattern the code is highly maintainable and readable in the eyes of any developer in the team. Thus allowing value deliveries to be carried out with a cleaner and faster development.

Below is an illustrative image about this design pattern [1].
